<h2> My 5 favorite films of all time </h2>


<ol>
        <li>
<p> <strong> Titanic </strong></p>
        </li>

<p> This is probably the greatest movie of all time, in my opinion. and the reason why this movie is so great has nothing to do with the filming or the lighting, not even the story. the reason why <br> </br>


this movie is so great its because of the emotion it portraits, when you make a person cries watching a movie, that's a movie they will never forget.</p>


        <li>
<p> <strong> The Sandlot </strong></p>
        </li>

<p> This movie is very personal to me, and it's not just because i love baseball, it's because i felt i could relate to the kids in this film, they came from nothing and all they wanted to do was play baseball <br> </br>


and seeing them encounter so many struggles and still make it through and follow their dreams, inspired me so much as a child. </p>


        <li>
<p> <strong> The Big Lebowski </strong> </p>
        </li>

<p> I don't remember ever a movie making me laugh so much than this movie, right from the beginning to end, this movie was hilarious. and Big Lebowski has such a cool personality </p>


        <li>
<p> <strong>  Rocky </strong> </p>
        </li>

<p> This is easily one of the most inspiring movies of all time, on top of that the cinematography of this movie by the time they were shooting, is just ridiculous, they had one of the first ever camera stabilizers used in this movie, they did things <br> </br>


that people didn't think possible at the time. </p>


        <li>
<p> <strong> Pulp Fiction </strong> </p>
        </li>

<p> This movie is not just very funny, this movie is a cinematographic master piece, the acting, the story, the emotions, everything was perfect, this one is one of the greatest movies there is. </p>
